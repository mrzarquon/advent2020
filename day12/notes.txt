Action N means to move north by the given value.
Action S means to move south by the given value.
Action E means to move east by the given value.
Action W means to move west by the given value.
Action L means to turn left the given number of degrees.
Action R means to turn right the given number of degrees.
Action F means to move forward by the given value in the direction the ship is currently facing.



F10 would move the ship 10 units east (because the ship starts by facing east) to east 10, north 0.
N3 would move the ship 3 units north to east 10, north 3.
F7 would move the ship another 7 units east (because the ship is still facing east) to east 17, north 3.
R90 would cause the ship to turn right by 90 degrees and face south; it remains at east 17, north 3.
F11 would move the ship 11 units south to east 17, south 8.

At the end of these instructions, the ship's Manhattan distance (sum of the absolute values of its east/west position and its north/south position) from its starting position is 17 + 8 = 25.

Figure out where the navigation instructions lead. What is the Manhattan distance between that location and the ship's starting position?
